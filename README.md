# Algorithms-from-scratch

This is my Machine Learning study and discovery journey routine.
I want to keep doing this project since in my opinion this is the only way to understand those concepts that I am interested in and improve my coding skills in Python.

I love discover, detect, learning, and solving problems.

Every hard problems can be cracked into smaller and basic problems.

Biology, Physics and Math, etc... they all can be the inspiration of the frontier algorithms.

ANN is a shine of 2024 Nobel Prize for Physics...

Keep Rolling!
